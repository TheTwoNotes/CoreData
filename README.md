# CoreData

Simple demonstration project to show using Core Data with relational managed objects in a SwiftUI app

For simplicity:
* All inputs are String
* No input content validation is being done
* No data formatting for input or display is being performed

Originally, this was just using local Core Data but have now incorporated CloudKit to allow synchronization across multiple devices on the same Apple ID account.
